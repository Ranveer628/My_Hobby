      <p>My hobby is drawing. I  mostly draw pictures of people, animals and birds. I use crayons, pencils, colour pencils etc to draw pictures. During birthdays of my parents, sister and friends, I gift my best drawings to them. I spend my free time drawing pictures.I was popular among my friends in my school days. Everyone wanted to make drawing for them. It gave me more motivation to do something new and to upgrade my skill. I got first prize in my school for the drawing competition.I like to draw the sunset the most. I love drawing. I like to become an artist when I grow up.

drawing is a particular hobby which i love it.
without colours i can't imagine drawing because without colours the painting looks dull
so drawing is the most perfect hobby for me.</p>

        <h1 id="name">Maqbool Fida Husain </h1>
        <br>
        <p>M.F. Husain was born in Pandharpur Maharashtra. Primarily a self-taught artist, Husain was part of the revolutionary Progressive Artistsâ€™ Group. In 1947 his first exhibition was conducted at the Bombay Art Society where his painting Sunhera Sansaar was shown. From 1948 to 1950 there were a series of exhibitions of Husain's paintings all over India. By the 1960s, his paintings were exhibited in the art galleries of Prague and Zurich. Husain soon became a name synonymous with modern Indian art due to his fearless depiction of his imagination, as well as, his willingness to absorb international influences. However, most of his work since his formative years has been rooted in Indian vocabulary and aesthetics.</p>
